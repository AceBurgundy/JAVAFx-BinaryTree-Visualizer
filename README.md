# Binary Tree Visualizer App

## Overview

The **Binary Tree Visualizer** is a JavaFX application designed to help users understand and visualize binary trees. With this interactive tool, you can create binary trees, visualize their structure, and animate different tree traversal algorithms. The app also allows you to input custom number sequences to generate and explore your own binary trees.
